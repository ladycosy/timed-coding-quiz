# timed-coding-quiz
This is a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. The quiz will include time and score count. The user's data will be stored in the local storage - highscores.  

This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS `powered by JavaScript` code that I have written.

## User Story

```
As a coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## Acceptance Criteria

  * Questions contain buttons for each answer
  
  * When answer is clicked, the next question appears
  
  * If the answer clicked was incorrect then subtract time from the clock

  * The quiz should end when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0

  * When the game ends, it should display their score and give the user the ability to save their initials and their score
